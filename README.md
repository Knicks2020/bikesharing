                                                      NYC Bike Data
	  New York City.  The city that never sleeps.  This bike analysis definitely helps the city to hold on to that nickname.  The goal of our analysis was not just to give you data on bike riders around the 5 boroughs of NY but to assist in giving you a base line to help you decide whether or not to open a bike riding business in Iowa or perhaps another city.  
	  In this analysis we will provide a breakdown of riders based on gender, day of week when they rent and then also specific hours of the day.  We wanted to make sure that we covered all of this so that you have a widespread analysis of the different times that riders rent.  Currently the population of the city of Manhattan is 1.6 million.  When compared to a population of approximately 220k in Des Moines Iowa, that is an 11:50 ratio.  Based on that type of difference, we know we needed to provide you with very specific data, which we believe that we have done.
